# Image Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder files for the website images. These files have a `.png` extension but are actually text files to serve as placeholders until you add real images.

## How to Replace with Real Images

1. Create or obtain real images for each service
2. Name your images exactly the same as these placeholder files:
   - trash-hauling.png
   - tractor-work.png
   - landscaping.png
   - wood-chipping.png
   - light-excavation.png
   - tree-stump-removal.png
   - company-image.png

3. Replace these placeholder files with your real images
4. Make sure your images are properly sized (recommended: 800x600 pixels)

## Image Dimensions

- Service images: 800x600 pixels (landscape orientation)
- Company image: 800x600 pixels (landscape orientation)

## Tips for Good Images

- Use high-quality, professional images
- Make sure images are relevant to the service they represent
- Optimize images for web to keep file sizes small
- Use consistent style and lighting across all images
